## Road Damage Detection & Classification

### Intro
This project is my final research works to detect and classify road damage, processing the detected object with matemathical equation to find a real size, so we can determine th elevel of road damage based on SDI (Surface Distress Index) method. In this part, lets just goes down into the detection model and prediction in real-time condition process
